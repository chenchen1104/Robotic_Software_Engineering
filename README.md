##The introduction of the existing sevice robot<br>
The International Organization for Standardization defines a “service robot” as a robot “that performs useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation applications.It can provide services that are benificial for humanity. Service robots are intelligent machines with sensory, thinking, decision-making, and action functions. They can be divided into two categories: professional service robots and personal service robots.<br>
###professional service robots<br>
Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) represent the largest fraction in the professional service robot market. They are established in non-manufacturing environments, mainly logistics, and have lots of potential in manufacturing. The second largest category, inspection and maintenance robots, covers a wide range of robots from rather low-priced standard units to expensive custom solutions. Service robots for defense applications accounted for 5% of the total number of service robots for professional use sold in 2018. Thereof, unmanned aerial vehicles seem to be the application with the highest share. Among medical robots,the most important medical applications are robot assisted surgery or therapy and rehabilitation systems. Medical robots are among the most expensive service robots. powered human exoskeletons support ergonomic working by reducing loads on the worker. There is a high growth potential for this kind of robot.<br>
